## Publify 8.0

It's been 5 months since Publify 7.1, and considering the figures, Publify 8.0
is the biggest release we ever pushed in 9 years: 474 commits, 71 issues
closed, 8 contributors, 567 files changed, 60,767 additions and 45,166
deletions.

But you probably don't care about numbers that much, except if you're wondering
whether or not the project is till alive. TL; DR: it is.

The project itself has known one big change, [moving from Fred's personal
Github account to a dedicated organization][1]. We have been thinking about it
for a while, and we believe it's the best we could do for Publify.

### Simpler, better, faster

Last summer, [we started to rethink what we wanted Publify to be][2]. At a time
where online publishing is more or less split between Wordpress, hosted
platforms and static engines, being "only" a blogging platform had no meaning
anymore. We started to extend publishing capabilities, choosing Twitter pushed
short notes as a first step before we add more content type. This led to
Publify 7.0, and once again we knew it was the way to go.

Before adding these feature, we wanted Publify 8.0 to rebuild the whole user
experience. It had to be simpler, clearer and better, far from the MS Word 97
style that prevails in Web publishing since more than 10 years.

This meant a simpler interface with a single, smaller menu, getting out of the
old create / read / update / delete scheme when possible, merging some sections
and finally removing lots of things. This also means using the most of large
screens capabilities, using _responsive_ layouts as much as we could, even
though it made the job more difficult at some point.

The editor, it has been completely revamped, following the way opened by both
Medium and Ghost. We've pushed aside everything that may distract you from
writing. The post settings are 1 click away from the editor so you won't feel
lost anyway. We know how much work is left to get a really classy tool, but
we're working on it.

The notes have got improvement. When replying to a tweet, Publify now displays
the original tweet so readers can keep the context this was done.

Users profiles have been improved to. Each user now has its own detailed page
with avatar, contact links, short bio and indeed the published content.

### Missing in action

The old categories VS tags separation is no more. We merged the first into the
seconds as a strict categorization has no real meaning on most blogs. Don't
worry about your URLs, we took care of everything, eventually creating the
redirects you needed.

The _excerpt_ has been removed. Excerpt was meant to display a different
content on the listing page and on the post itself. It was an interesting
feature, but only a handful of people, if none was using it, and it made the
editor more complicated than necessary.

The old [Typographic theme][3] is not part of the core anymore. It has moved to
its own project and will still be maintained.

The old XMLRPC backend has been discontinued. This means Publify does not
support desktop clients anymore. This choice has been motivated by the fact
that the APIs it was relying had not been updated for 10 years, and that most
desktop editors are not maintained anymore either. Web browsers capabilities
have evolved, and you can now have a fairly decent editor with local saving
without the need of a desktop application.

### Under the hood

Publify has been around for 9 years now. Rails was not 1.0 yet, and some of our
code was older than you can ever imagine.

Publify 8.0 got rid of most of that legacy code. The old Prototype based
helpers that made Rails famous back then left the building. Prototype itself
has finally been replaced by Jquery, and Rails i18n allowed the _Globalize_
based translation system to enjoy a deserved retirement. Most helpers have been
removed too, as most of them were only used in one place.

This should not affect you unless you're running custom themes and plugins. If
so, have a look at the Bootstrap theme to see how we're now working.

That's all folks, you can now download Publify, or give it a try on [our demo
platform][4].
