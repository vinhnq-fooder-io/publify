These are converters for migrating from other blog systems to Publify. In
general, you're best off using the converter that best-matches your blog
system, and then falling back to the RSS or Feed converter if the others fail.
These converters aren't always well tested, so please back up your data before
converting, and please file bugs at https://github.com/publify/publify.

Available converters:

* feed.rb: Converts from any RSS or Atom feed.  Requires the 'feed_tools' gem.
* blogger.rb: Converts from an exported Blogger XML.  Requires the 'feedzirra' gem.
